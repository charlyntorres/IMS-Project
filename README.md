# Inventory Management System

## Project Description
The Inventory Management System (IMS) is a backend web application designed to manage an inventory of items. Users can perform basic CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete—on the inventory. The application features a simple and user-friendly interface, leveraging modern backend technologies for seamless performance and scalability.


## Objective
The objective of this project is to:
1. Demonstrate the use of Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and MongoDB/Mongoose to build a full-stack CRUD application.
2. Implement a structured and scalable backend architecture.
3. Provide a real-world example of managing data and server-client communication in web development.


## Technology Stack
##### Backend
- **Node.js:** Runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js:** Framework to handle routing and middleware.
- **MongoDB: NoSQL** database for storing inventory data.
- **Mongoose:** ODM library for MongoDB to manage database schemas and queries.
##### Frontend
- **EJS:** Templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML pages.


## Core Features
##### 1. Item Management:
- **Create:** Add new items to the inventory.
- **Read:** View a list of all items in the inventory.
- **Update:** Edit details of existing items.
- **Delete:** Remove items from the inventory.
##### 2. Search and Filter: *(Optional)*
- Search items by name or category.
- Filter items based on specific criteria (e.g., category or stock status).


## System Architecture
The IMS is designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for maintainability and scalability:
- **Model:** Defines the data structure and interacts with the database using Mongoose.
- **View:** Renders dynamic content using EJS templates.
- **Controller:** Handles application logic and routes requests between models and views.


## Frontend Integration
EJS templates will render dynamic pages for the CRUD operations:
1. Index Page: Displays a table listing all items.
2. Add Item Page: Contains a form to create a new item.
3. Edit Item Page: Pre-fills item data for editing.
4. Delete Confirmation Page: Confirms item deletion.


## Future Enhancements
- Implement user authentication for secure access.
- Add support for image uploads for inventory items.
- Include advanced filtering and sorting options.


## Conclusion
The Inventory Management System showcases how to build a robust backend application with Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and MongoDB. This project serves as a foundational example for CRUD-based web applications and can be expanded with additional features based on real-world requirements.
